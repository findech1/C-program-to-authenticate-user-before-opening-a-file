C program to authenticate user before opening a file
Write a C program to authenticate user before opening a file. If user name and or password is wrong the
program will display appropriate login error message. After three invalid attempts the user will be
logged out. However, if user name is abc1 and password is abc2 then the program allows the user to
successfully open a file called marks.txt. The program will allow the user enter scores for a set of
students. The program will then award an appropriate grade remark for each score according to the following criteria:

Score Remark
0-39 Below expectation(BE)
40-49 Approaching expectation(AE)
50-59 Met expectation(ME)
>=60 Exceeded expectation(EE)
The score and remarks should be written in marks.txt file
